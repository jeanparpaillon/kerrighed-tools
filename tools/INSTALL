1/ Pre-requisites
=================

   Kerrighed tools requires the following to be built and installed:

- automake      : version >= 1.9
- autoconf      : version >= 2.59
- libtool
- gcc           : 3.3.x is the recommended compiler for Linux Kernel. 
  		  Kerrighed is reported to build with 4.1 series.
- libkerrighed 
- libkrgthread

   Optional features requires the following:

- lsb_release	: to install Kerrighed startup scripts into /etc/init.d

2/ Quick install
================

	  % ./configure
 	  % make
	  % make install

3/ Detailed configuration
=========================

3.1/ Generic configure options
==============================

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

3.2/ Installation Names
=======================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

3.3/ Operation Controls
=======================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

3.4/ Configure tools
====================

   Following options can be passed to the tools configure script:

  --enable-external-kerrighed
                          Compile with external libkerrighed [default: use
                          internal if present]
  --disable-service       Do not install kerrighed service [default: enable]
