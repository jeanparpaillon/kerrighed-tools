WHAT IS KERRIGHED ?

	
  Kerrighed is a Single System Image operating system for clusters.
  Kerrighed offers the view of a unique SMP machine on top of a
  cluster of standard PCs.

  Kerrighed is implemented as an extension to Linux operating system
  (a set of Linux modules and a small patch to the kernel).

  Kerrighed main features are :

    * Customizable Cluster Wide Process Scheduler.

        Processes are automatically scheduled over the cluster nodes
        to balance the CPU load using the Kerrighed default scheduling
        algorithm. However, Kerrighed offers a toolkit to easily write
        customized schedulers hot-loadable through kernel modules.

    * Cluster Wide Shared Memory.

        System V memory segments can operate through the whole
        cluster, just like on an SMP machine.

    * Process Checkpointing.

        Processes can be checkpointed and restarted on any cluster
        node.

    * Cluster Wide Unix Process Interface.

        All traditional UNIX process management commands (top, ps, kill,
        etc) operate cluster wide. Moreover, process identifiers (pid)
        are unique cluster wide.

    * Customizable Single System Image Features.

        Single system image features (shared memory, global scheduler,
        migrable streams, etc) can be enabled or desabled on a per
        process basis.

  The present implemention of Kerrighed is compatible with version
  2.6.30 of Linux kernel.
