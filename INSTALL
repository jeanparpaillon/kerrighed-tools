1/ Pre-requisites
=================

   Kerrighed requires the following to be built and installed:

- automake      : version >= 1.9
- autoconf      : version >= 2.59
- gcc           : see linux 2.6.30 gcc recommendations (<linux>/Documentation/Changes)
- Various tools :
  - libtool
  - pkg-config
  - awk (GNU awk is preferred)
  - bzip2
  - patch
  - wget

   Optional features requires the following:

- xsltproc      : allow to create documentation in various formats (only needed by
  		  maintainer.
- Python (>= 2.5) : Python interface is provided to libkerrighed (hotplug part)

2/ Quick install
================

Type the following in the base directory of the Kerrighed
distribution:

	% ./configure
	% make
	% make install

3/ Detailed configuration
=========================

   Kerrighed is made of several parts which can be built and installed
independently:

- kerrighed kernel (modified Linux kernel)
- libs
- tools
- scripts
- tests

3.1/ Generic configure options
==============================

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

3.2/ Installation Names
=======================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

3.3/ Operation Controls
=======================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

3.4/ Specific configure options
=====================================

   Following options can be passed to the configure script:

   --disable-kernel  	   Disable automatic kernel configuration/build/install
   			   [default=enable]
   --disable-libkerrighed  Disable libkerrighed [default=enable]
   --disable-python	   Disable Python code [default=enable]
   --disable-tools	   Disable tools [default=enable]
   --enable-kerrighed-host Enable Kerrighed host service [default=disable]
   --enable-tests	   Globally enable tests [default=disable]
   --disable-tests-ktp	   Disable 'ktp' tests
   --disable-tests-apps	   Disable 'apps' tests
   --disable-tests-proc	   Disable 'proc' tests
   --disable-tests-benchmark
			   Disable 'benchmark' tests

   --with-kernel-mirror	   kernel.org mirror used to get vanilla kernel
   			   [default=ftp.eu.kernel.org]
   --with-kernel-config	   config|menuconfig|xconfig|gconfig|defconfig|allmodconfig|allyesconfig|allnoconfig
			   If you use automatic kernel config/build/install, use one of these target to configure
			   the kernel.
                           [default=defconfig]
   --with-kernel-config-file
			   If specified, path to a .config file which will be used for kernel configuration.
			   [default=none]
   --with-ltp-base	   Path to ltp base dir [default=DATAROOTDIR/ltp]

3.5/ Build from outside of source tree
======================================

 Compilation and installation can be done from outside of source dir.
 Just create a new directory where you want to build and cd into it. Call
 configure script from this dir.
 All make targets can be used as usual.
